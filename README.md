## My process

I started looking at the design preview that i downloaded from Frontend Mentor, then i followed the style-guide file to make sure that my code was in order. 

After making sure about few things, then i started to write my code in HTML first, then after i finished writing it in HTML, i started to apply some designs with CSS.

### Built with

- HTML5 
- CSS (Flexbox, margin, padding, etc.)


### What I learned

I learned few brand new things that i haven't learned before, such as: 

- Using semantics can be useful.


### Continued development

I'll learn more about flexbox concepts, margin, padding, and i'll try to use more "nav", "span", "div" in the future so that my codes look elegant.
